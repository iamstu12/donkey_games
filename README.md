# Brief

You have been hired by Donkey Games, a small games developer in Dundee. They are planning their next release and want to use data to decide what kind of game to make. They have a dataset that contains historical information on the top selling games of all time.

They want to understand what types of games sell a lot of copies. In particular they are looking for analysis that helps them decide which direction to take their company in.

Youâ€™ll need to think carefully about what information is going to be useful to the client.
