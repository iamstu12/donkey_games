# Introduction 

The following report provides an exploratory analysis into the sales of video games. The data used for this report contains the global sales of games dating as far back as 1970 through to the present. Having such a vast range of games sales allows for a interesting look in to trends in top games across the years in order to identify what types of games, historically have performed well.

# The Data

### General Observations

**A brief glimpse at the data:**

```{r, echo = FALSE}

clean_sales_data %>% 
  head()

```
The data is an amalgamation of 4 data sets, each with their own set of sales and useful information. The final data contains the most up to date sales figures for each game as of 2019.
